Hi there, welcome to the Excel Data Merger project. 

When I was doing a final assignment for my high school Stats course, I needed every day's step count for at least 365 days.
It would have been a huge pain to manually enter a year's worth data into an Excel file, so I found an app to do it for me.

However, there was a huge problem. Each day's step count was distributed into various time blocks, so the entire sheet consisted of
tens of thousands of rows. 
I did't need the specifics. I needed the SUM!

There was no way I was going to merge the values day by day. That would take longer than what it takes to graduate from uni.
I was doomed, I thought. 

I searched through every corner of Chrome, Github, Reddit... even Excel University. Yes, that really exists. Yet, no one could solve my problem.
So I decided to solve my own problem by creating this program. 

One thing I can tell you for sure, the learning curve was a real struggle. 
I encountered way more errors here than I did in a full year of comp sci.

"What is Jupyter?" 
"How do I correct my errors when I don't even know what they are yapping about?"
"ModuleNotFoundError"
"KeyError"
"ImportError"
"NotImplementedError"
"..."
"It's another error."
It was at that moment when I knew what depression meant. 

I didn't even know what I was doing sometimes. At one point I was just like, "Wow, the console is so colorful I love it!"

Ok, back to the code. I went to the Internet for self-help. I worked through bug fixes and learned how to answer to my own questions, one by one.
After some intense headaches, I finally crafted a program that solved the problem. I hope it can be of a little use to you, 
or I hope you simply have fun reading through it!
