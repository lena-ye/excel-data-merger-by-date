Hi there, welcome to the Excel Data Merger project. 

When I was doing a final assignment for my high school Stats course, I needed every day's step count for at least 365 days.
I found an app to enter a year's data into an Excel file for me. However, there was a huge problem. 
Each day's step count was a distribution of steps across several time intervals, so the entire sheet consisted of
tens of thousands of rows. 

There was no way I was going to merge the values day by day. I searched through every corner of Chrome: Github, Reddit, even Excel University. 
Yet, no one could solve my problem. So I decided to solve my own problem through writing this program. 

One thing I can tell you for sure, the learning curve was a real struggle. 
I encountered way more errors here than I did in a full year of comp sci class in high school.
At one point I was so lost, I was just gazing at the console and expressing my love for the colorful display.

I went to the Internet for education and help with the code. I worked through bug fixes and learned how to answer to my own questions, one by one.
After some intense headaches, I finally crafted a program that solved the problem. I hope it can be of a little use to you.
